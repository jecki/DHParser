The "DHParser/templates" sub-directory contains templates for python scripts
that are generated by DHParser when creating a new project. Usually, this is
done by substituting placeholders withing the template like "{name}" via
the format()-method of Python's string type.

Scripts are being generated within these modules:
  - DHParser/srcipts/dhparser.py
  - DHParser/dsl.py
  - DHParser/ebnf.py
