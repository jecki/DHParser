"""
Module ``compile`` contains a skeleton class for syntax
driven compilation support. Class ``Compiler`` can serve as base
class for a compiler. Compiler objects
are callable an receive the Abstract syntax tree (AST)
as argument and yield whatever output the compiler produces. In
most Digital Humanities applications this will be
XML-code. However, it can also be anything else, like binary
code or, as in the case of DHParser's EBNF-compiler, Python
source code.

Function ``compile_source`` invokes all stages of the compilation
process, i.e. pre-processing, parsing, CST to AST-transformation
and compilation.

See module ``ebnf`` for a sample of the implementation of a
compiler object.

    Class Compiler is the abstract base class for compilers. Compiler
    objects are callable and take the root node of the abstract
    syntax tree (AST) as argument and return the compiled code in a
    format chosen by the compiler itself.

    Subclasses implementing a compiler must define `on_XXX()`-methods
    for each node name that can occur in the AST where 'XXX' is the
    node's name(for unnamed nodes it is the node's ptype without the
    leading colon ':').

    These compiler methods take the node on which they are run as
    argument. Other than in the AST transformation, which runs depth-first,
    compiler methods are called forward moving starting with the root
    node, and they are responsible for compiling the child nodes
    themselves. This should be done by invoking the `compile(node)`-
    method which will pick the right `on_XXX`-method. It is not
    recommended to call the `on_XXX`-methods directly.

    Attributes:
        context:  A list of parent nodes that ends with the currently
                compiled node.
        tree:  The root of the abstract syntax tree.
        finalizers:  A stack of tuples (function, parameters) that will be
                called in reverse order after compilation.

        _dirty_flag:  A flag indicating that the compiler has already been
                called at least once and that therefore all compilation
                variables must be reset when it is called again.
        _debug: A flag indicating that debugging is turned on the value
                for this flag is read before each call of the configuration
