'''Module ``ebnf`` provides an EBNF-parser-generator. The parser-generator
compiles an EBNF-Grammar into an executable Python-class. An instance of
this class can be called to parse text-documents conforming to the grammar.
It will the concrete-syntax-tree of the document. Various flavors of EBNF-
of PEG- (Parsing-Expression-Grammar) notations are supported.

Usually, the classes and functions provided by the DHParser.ebnf will
not be called directly, because it is much simpler to use the high-level
API in module :py:mod:`DHParser.dsl`, in particular
:py:func:`DHParser.dsl.create_parser`.

The ebnf-module is structured just like the parser-modules that are
generated by running the "dhparser"-script on an EBNF-grammar or
by executing the test-runner script in the project-directory of
a DHParser-project. It consists of the following sections, divided
by a comment-block with a sections name:

1. The *EBNF-preprocessor* takes care of
   chaining the main file and the included files (if there are
   any) into one single document that is passed on to the parser.
   (=> :py:func:`preprocessor_factory`)

2. The *EBNF-parser* translates the EBNF-grammar into a
   concrete-syntax-tree. (=> :py:class:`ConfigurableEBNFGrammar`)

3. The *AST-transformation* molds the concrete-syntax-tree into
   abstract-syntax-tree (AST) that represents the syntactical structure
   of the grammar-source-code. (=> :py:func:`get_ebnf_transformer`)

4. Finally, the *EBNF-compiler* compiles the AST into an executable
   Python-class that is a descendant of :py:class:`~parse.Grammar`
   and is composed mostly of instances of the parser-classes
   from module :py:mod:`DHParser.parse`. (=> :py:class:`EBNFCompiler`)

   (Each symbol of the grammar
   is represented by a class variable to which a nested call of
   parser-class-instantiations is assigned. These parser-instances
   serve as a prototype from which grammar objects are derived
   via deep-copy upon the instantiation of the grammar-class.)

   This section also contains source-code-snippets and -templates
   for the Python-parser code the compiler produces.

The most notable difference to ordinary DHParser-projects is that
the DHParser.ebnf-module contains two :py:class:`~parse.Grammar`-classes, one
for parsing code that strictly follows DHParser's EBNF-syntax
(:py:class:`ConfigurableEBNFGrammar`) and another one that is able to
parse many different brands of EBNF-syntax (:py:class:`HeuristicEBNFGrammar`)
at the cost of parsing speed. When parsing or compiling an EBNF-grammar with
any of the high-level functions into Python-code, the faster "configurable"
EBNF-grammar is tried first, and, if that fails with particular errors which
suggest that the failure might be merely due to the use of a different brand
of EBNF, a second attempt is made with the slower heuristic EBNF-parser.

The EBNF-compiler is actually split into two classes, :py:class:`EBNFCompiler`,
which contains the EBNF-AST -> Python compiler proper, and
:py:class:`EBNFDirectives` which is a helper class to keep track of the
directives used to avoid overburdening the compiler-class with instance
variables.

Just as DHParser's (auto-)generated parser-scripts, the classes contained in
:py:mod:`DHParser.ebnf` should not be instantiated directly. Other than
the parser scripts, though, the ebnf-module does not provide Junctions
with factory-functions for each stage from preprocessing to compiling.
Instead it provides factory-functions that return one singleton instance
per thread of each class, namely:

* :py:func:`~ebnf.get_ebnf_parser`
* :py:func:`~ebnf.get_ebnf_transformer`
* :py:func:`~ebnf.get_ebnf_compiler`

These are supplemented by the quick-use-functions:

* :py:func:`~ebnf.preprocess_ebnf`
* :py:func:`~ebnf.parse_ebnf`
* :py:func:`~ebnf.transform_ebnf`
* :py:func:`~ebnf.compile_ebnf`

The following example shows how the classes and functions of the
ebnf-module can be connected to produce runnable Python-code from
an EBNF-grammar. It is meant as a help to understand the role of
these classes better as well as - in a simplified manner - the
basic working mechanisms of higher level functions like
:py:func:`DHParser.dsl.create_parser`. In any practical application,
the use of the high-level functions from :py:mod:`DHParser.dsl` is
to be preferred. One can think of the DHParser.dsl-module
as the public API of the ebnf-module.

This said, here is how a Python-parser can be generated
from a grammar, step by step::

    >>> arithmetic_ebnf = r"""
    ... @ whitespace  = vertical
    ... @ literalws   = right
    ... @ drop        = whitespace, strings
    ... expression = term  { (add | sub) term}
    ... term       = factor { (div | mul) factor}
    ... factor     = [minus] (NUMBER | VARIABLE | group)
    ... group      = "(" expression ")"
    ... add        = "+"
    ... sub        = "-"
    ... mul        = "*"
    ... div        = "/"
    ... minus      = `-`
    ... NUMBER     = /(?:0|(?:[1-9]\\d*))(?:\\.\\d+)?/~
    ... VARIABLE   = /[A-Za-z]/~"""

    >>> # 1. Compilation of an EBNF-grammar into Python-source-code
    >>> ebnf_parser = ConfigurableEBNFGrammar()
    >>> ebnf_transformer = EBNFTransform()
    >>> ebnf_compiler = EBNFCompiler()

    >>> CST = ebnf_parser(arithmetic_ebnf)
    >>> AST = ebnf_transformer(CST)   # CST should be considered invalid after that
    >>> ebnf_compiler.set_grammar_name("Arithmetic")
    >>> python_src = ebnf_compiler(AST)
    >>> assert not AST.errors
    >>> print(python_src)
    class ArithmeticGrammar(Grammar):
        r"""Parser for an Arithmetic source file.
        """
        expression = Forward()
        disposable__ = re.compile('$.')
        static_analysis_pending__ = []  # type: List[bool]
        parser_initialization__ = ["upon instantiation"]
        COMMENT__ = r''
        comment_rx__ = RX_NEVER_MATCH
        WHITESPACE__ = r'\\s*'
        WSP_RE__ = mixin_comment(whitespace=WHITESPACE__, comment=COMMENT__)
        wsp__ = Whitespace(WSP_RE__)
        dwsp__ = Drop(Whitespace(WSP_RE__))
        VARIABLE = Series(RegExp('[A-Za-z]'), dwsp__)
        NUMBER = Series(RegExp('(?:0|(?:[1-9]\\\\d*))(?:\\\\.\\\\d+)?'), dwsp__)
        minus = Text("-")
        div = Series(Text("/"), dwsp__)
        mul = Series(Text("*"), dwsp__)
        sub = Series(Text("-"), dwsp__)
        add = Series(Text("+"), dwsp__)
        group = Series(Series(Drop(Text("(")), dwsp__), expression, Series(Drop(Text(")")), dwsp__))
        factor = Series(Option(minus), Alternative(NUMBER, VARIABLE, group))
        term = Series(factor, ZeroOrMore(Series(Alternative(div, mul), factor)))
        expression.set(Series(term, ZeroOrMore(Series(Alternative(add, sub), term))))
        root__ = expression
    <BLANKLINE>
    parsing: PseudoJunction = create_parser_junction(ArithmeticGrammar)
    get_grammar = parsing.factory # for backwards compatibility, only
    <BLANKLINE>

    >>> # 2. Execution of the Python-source and extraction of the Grammar-class
    >>> code = compile(DHPARSER_IMPORTS + python_src, '<string>', 'exec')
    >>> namespace = {}
    >>> exec(code, namespace)
    >>> ArithmeticGrammar = namespace['ArithmeticGrammar']

    >>> # 3. Instantiation of the Grammar class and parsing of an expression
    >>> arithmetic_parser = ArithmeticGrammar()
    >>> syntax_tree = arithmetic_parser("2 + 3 * 4")
    >>> print(syntax_tree.as_sxpr())
    (expression
      (term
        (factor
          (NUMBER "2")))
      (add "+")
      (term
        (factor
          (NUMBER "3"))
        (mul "*")
        (factor
          (NUMBER "4"))))

Of course, the first part, compiling of the grammar to Python-code,
could also have been achieved with::

    >>> python_src = compile_ebnf(arithmetic_ebnf, "Arithmetic").result

And for the execution of the Python-source and extraction of the Grammar-class,
one can use :py:func:`DHParser.toolkit.compile_python_object`::

    >>> from DHParser import toolkit
    >>> ArithmeticGrammar = toolkit.compile_python_object(
    ...     DHPARSER_IMPORTS + python_src, "ArithmeticGrammar")
    >>> arithmetic_parser = ArithmeticGrammar()
    >>> syntax_tree_2 = arithmetic_parser("2 + 3 * 4")
    >>> assert syntax_tree_2.equals(syntax_tree)

The recommended canonical way for the last step, however, would be::

    >>> parsing = toolkit.compile_python_object(
    ...     DHPARSER_IMPORTS + python_src, "parsing")
    >>> arithmetic_parser = parsing.factory()
    >>> syntax_tree_3 = arithmetic_parser("2 + 3 * 4")
    >>> assert syntax_tree_3.equals(syntax_tree)

By using the factory function of the parsing-junction to
get a grammar-object instead of instantiating it directly, it is avoided
to instantiate the grammar-object more than once per thread. Re-using
the same grammar-object is more efficient
than re-instantiating it for every new document to be parsed. At the same-time
grammar-objects must not be shared between threads or processes. (See also
:py:class:`~toolkit.ThreadLocalSingletonFactory`.)

class HeuristicEBNFGrammar(Grammar):
    r"""Parser for an EBNF source file that heuristically detects the
    used syntactical variant of EBNF on the fly.

    This grammar is tuned for flexibility, that is, it supports as many
    different flavors of EBNF as possible. However, this flexibility
    comes at the cost of some ambiguities. In particular:

       1. the alternative OR-operator / could be mistaken for the start
          of a regular expression and vice versa, and
       2. character ranges [a-z] can be mistaken for optional blocks
          and vice versa

    A strategy to avoid these ambiguities is to do all of the following:

        - replace the free_char-parser by a never matching parser
        - if this is done, it is safe to replace the char_range_heuristics-
          parser by an always matching parser
        - replace the regex_heuristics by an always matching parser

    Ambiguities can also be avoided by NOT using all the syntactic variants
    made possible by this EBNF-grammar within one and the same EBNF-document.

    :ivar error:  mapping of symbols to tuples of match conditions and
            customized error messages. A match condition can be
            either a string or a regular expression. The first
            error message where the search condition matches will
            be displayed. An empty string '' as search condition
            always matches, so in case of multiple error messages,
            this condition should be placed at the end.
    :ivar skip:  mapping of symbols to a list of search expressions. A
            search expressions can be either a string ot a regular
            expression. The closest match is the point of reentry
            for the series- or interleave-parser when a mandatory item

            the nodes produced by the parsers associated with these
            symbols will yield anonymous nodes just like "inner"

            ``DROP_WSP``, ``DROP_REGEXP`` or any name of a symbol of a
            disposable parser (e.g. '_linefeed') the results of which will

class EBNFCompiler(Compiler):
    r"""
    Generates a Parser from an abstract syntax tree of a grammar specified
    in EBNF-Notation.

    Usually, this class will not be instantiated or instances of this
    class be called directly. Rather high-level functions like
    :py:func:`~dsl.create_parser` or :py:func:`~dsl.compileEBNF`
    will be used to generate callable :py:class:`~parse.Grammar`-objects
    or Python-source-code from an EBNF-grammar.

    Instances of this class must be called with the root-node of the
    abstract syntax tree from an EBNF-specification of a formal language.
    The returned value is the Python-source-code of a Grammar class for
    this language that can be used to parse texts in this language.
    See classes :py:class:`compile.Compiler` and :py:class:`parser.Grammar`
    for more information.

    Additionally, class EBNFCompiler provides helper methods to generate
    code-skeletons for a preprocessor, AST-transformation and full
    compilation of the formal language. These method's names start with
    the prefix ``gen_``.

    :ivar current_symbols:  During compilation, a list containing the root
            node of the currently compiled definition as first element
            and then the nodes of the symbols that are referred to in
            the currently compiled definition.

    :ivar cache_literal_symbols: A cache for all symbols that are defined
            by literals, e.g. ``head = "<head>"``. This is used by the
            on_expression()-method.

    :ivar rules:  Dictionary that maps rule names to a list of Nodes that
            contain symbol-references in the definition of the rule.
            The first item in the list is the node of the rule
            definition itself. Example::

                alternative = a | b

            Now ``[node.content for node in self.rules['alternative']]``
            yields ``['alternative = a | b', 'a', 'b']``

    :ivar referred_symbols_cache: A dictionary that caches the results of
            method ``referred_symbols()``. ``referred_symbols()`` maps a
            to the set of symbols that are directly or indirectly
            referred to in the definition of the symbol.

    :ivar directly_referred_cache: A dictionary that caches the results
            of method :py:meth:`directly_referred_symbols`, which yields
            the set of symbols that are referred to in the definition
            of a particular symbol.

    :ivar referred_otherwise: A set of symbols which are directly
           referred to in a directive, macro or macro-symbol. It does
           not matter whether these symbals are reachable (i.e. directly
           oder indirectly referred to) from the root-symbol.

    :ivar symbols:  A mapping of symbol names to their usages (not
            their definition!) in the EBNF source.

    :ivar py_symbols:  A set of symbols that are referred to in the
            grammar, but are (or must be) defined in Python-code
            outside the Grammar-class resulting from the compilation
            of the EBNF-source, as, for example, references to
            user-defined custom-parsers. (See :py:class:`~parse.Custom`)

    :ivar variables:  A set of symbols names that are used with the
            Pop or Retrieve operator. Because the values of these
            symbols need to be captured they are called variables.
            See ``test_parser.TestPopRetrieve`` for an example.

    :ivar forward:  A set of symbols that require a forward operator.

    :ivar definitions:  A dictionary of definitions. Other than ``rules``
            this maps the symbols to their compiled definienda.

    :ivar macros:  A dictionary that maps macro names to the
            macro-definition, or, more precisely to a tuple of the
            node of the macro-symbol, the string-list or macro arguments
            and the node of the AST that is substituted for the
            macro-symbol.

    :ivar macro_stack:  A stack (i.e. list) of macro names needed to
            ensure that macro calls are not recursively nested.

    :ivar required_keywords: A list of keywords (like ``comment__`` or
            ``whitespace__``) that need to be defined at the beginning
            of the grammar class because they are referred to later.

    :ivar deferred_tasks:  A list of callables that is filled during
            compilation, but that will be executed only after
            compilation has finished. Typically, it contains
            semantic checks that require information that
            is only available upon completion of compilation.

    :ivar root_symbol: The name of the root symbol.

    :ivar directives:  A record of all directives and their default values.

    :ivar defined_directives:  A dictionary of all directives that have already
            been defined, mapped onto the list of nodes where they have
            been (re-)defined. Except for those directives
            contained in EBNFDirectives.REPEATABLE_DIRECTIVES, directives
            must only be defined once.

    :ivar consumed_custom_errors:  A set of symbols for which a custom error
            has been defined and(!) consumed during compilation. This
            allows to add a compiler error in those cases where (i) an
            error message has been defined but will never be used or (ii)
            an error message is accidentally used twice. For examples, see
            ``test_ebnf.TestErrorCustomization``.

    :ivar consumed_skip_rules: The same as ``consumed_custom_errors`` only for
            in-series-resume-rules (aka 'skip-rules') for Series-parsers.

    :ivar P: a dictionary that maps parser class names to qualified names in
            cases a parser class name has also been used as a symbol name
            in the grammar. (e.g. Text -> parser_namespace\_\_.Text)

    :ivar re_flags:  A set of regular expression flags to be added to all
            regular expressions found in the current parsing process

    :ivar python_src:  A string that contains the python source code that was
            the outcome of the last EBNF-compilation.

    :ivar grammar_name:  The name of the grammar to be compiled

    :ivar grammar_source:  The source code of the grammar to be compiled.
