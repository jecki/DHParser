=======

DHParser is both suitable for small projects or "on the fly" use of
parsing expression grammars as a more powerful substitute for regular
expressions and for big projects. (The workflow for the latter is
described in the :doc:`StepByStepGuide` as well
as :doc:`manuals/05_testing`)
The following manuals provide a comprehensive exposition of the
capabilities of DHParser. Each manual is related to one of the
major modules of DHParser. It is recommended to read the :doc:`Overview`,
first, and then read as much of the manuals as needed.
The usage and API of DHParser is furthermore described
in the doc-strings of its modules which also contain
many runnable examples.
