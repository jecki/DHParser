Welcome to DHParser's documentation!
====================================

DHParser is a parser-generator and and domain-specific-language
construction kit, designed for but not restricted to
Digital-Humanities-applications.

DHParser offers:

* Rapid-Prototyping of EBNF-based grammar-specifications with support for
  different flavors of EBNF 
* Macros to reduce code-repetition within grammars and includes to
  avoid code-repetition between grammars.
* Parsing-Expression-Grammar (PEG)-parser with memoization
  and full left-recursion support
* unit-testing-framework for grammars
* post-mortem debugger for generated parsers
* support for fail-tolerant parsing
* customizable error messages
* extensive tree-processing facilities
* support for building language servers (experimental)
* full unicode support

DHParser is by now mature and "production ready". It is being used in several projects,
most notably for the domain specific notation of the `Medieval Latin Dictionary`_
and the Typescript-to-Python-interface-transpiler `ts2python`_

Install DHParser
----------------

.. code:: bash

    $ python -m pip install --user DHParser

In order to use DHParser directly from the git-repository, the best way is to make
a shallow clone of the repository and then add a symlink to the DHParser-subdirectory
inside the DHParser-repository in your project's directory. For setting up an entirely
new project with DHParser without using "pip install", the commands are the following:

.. code:: bash

   $ git clone --depth=1 https://gitlab.lrz.de/badw-it/DHParser
   $ python3 DHParser/DHParser/scripts/dhparser.py MyNewParserProject
   $ ln -s ../DHParser/DHParser MyNewParserProject/DHParser

In case you would like to use latest bugfixes from the development-branch the first command
should be exchanged with:

.. code:: bash

   $ git clone --depth=1 --single-branch --branch development https://gitlab.lrz.de/badw-it/DHParser

In order to verify that your local clone of the DHParser-repository has been
correctly linked to your project's directory, type:

.. code:: bash

    $ cd MyNewParserProject
    $ python3 tst_MyNewParserProect_grammar.py
