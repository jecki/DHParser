DHParser User's Guide
*********************

This User Guide explains:

1. How to define an EBNF-grammar for your domain specific language (DSL)
   and how to generate a parser for this grammar.
2. How to declare AST-Transformations to transform the concrete syntax tree (CST) that
   the parser produces into an abstract syntax-tree (AST).
3. How to write tests for the grammar and how to debug the parser.
4. How to write a compiler that walks the abstract-syntax-tree to produce either
   data-structures or code, depending on what the purpose of your domain specific language is.
5. How to write a language server to get editor support for your domain specific language.

The guide does not explain how to design a domain specific language for a specific application area.
In other words, this is not a textbook on domain specific language design for the Digital Humanities,
just a manual for DHParser.
