## Goals

* create a non-validating XML-processor
* parsing and compiling of XML-files into Element-Trees
* serializing Element-Tress as XML
* full support of valid any XML-file
* round-trip: valid XML can be turned into an XML file and
  serialized into XML again, without loss of data, i.e. re-parsing
  yields the same element-tree ("structural identity").


## Optional (future) Goals

* support all validity constraints mentioned in
  https://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/
* create validating XML-processor, i.e. support for DTDs, in particular
  checking element tree against DTD
* add a python-API for semantic checks Ã  la schematron, only simpler ;-)
* preservance of "insignificant whitespace", i.e. support
  round-trip with "string-identity"


## Non-Goals

* support for HTML
* support of Carriage Return, i.e. Windows line endings...

## Status

+ Parses XML files, i.e. parser and AST-transformation are complete
+ simple XML files are compiled into an element-tree
- limited support for CharData
- no support for CDATA-sections
- processing instrcutions not yet compiled
- no processing of DTDs
