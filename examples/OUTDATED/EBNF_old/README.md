This EBNF-grammar is tunes towards maximal flexibility. It's purpose is 
to support as many different variants of EBNF as possible. Therefore,
it may look somewhat redundant and contrived at first sight. For simpler
examples for formulating EBNF in EBNF itself, see the `grammar_examples`-
subdirectory.
