<H2><A NAME="SECTION00061000000000000000">
5.1 Starting a predefined simulation</A>
</H2>

<P>
After successfully starting CoopSim you should see an application
Window like this:

<P>
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
<IMG
  WIDTH="400" HEIGHT="310" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="./app_start.png"
 ALT="Image app_start">
</DIV>

<P>
In the beginning the screen is empty, of course. You will notice four notebook
pages named: <I>Tournament</I>, <I>Ecological Simulation</I>, <I>Simplex
  Diagram</I> and <I>User Defined Strategies</I>. The purpose of these pages will
be explained later. First, we will just start the simulation <I>Simple
  Example</I>. This simulation is preselected when the program starts up (you can
see which simulation is active and which simulations are available in the
<I>Simulation</I> menu), so it is just enough to click the <I>Continue
  Simulation</I> button to start the simulation. This is the button with the
blue arrow pointing to the right. It is the second button from the left
in the button row under the menu. After a short time of calculating the result
of the tournament should appear on the <I>Tournament</I> page:

<P>
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
<IMG
  WIDTH="400" HEIGHT="310" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="./tournament_page.png"
 ALT="Image tournament_page">
</DIV>

<P>
The tournament page displays the following information:

<P>

<OL>
<LI>The strategies that took part in the tournament.
</LI>
<LI>Then ranking of the strategies.
</LI>
<LI>The outcome of each single match of a pair of strategies as well as
the first and last 50 moves of the players, where <B>0</B> indicates a defection
and a <B>1</B> a cooperative move.
</LI>
<LI>The ranking of the strategies in the ecological simulation after a
certain number of generations.
</LI>
</OL>

<P>
You can scroll the contents of the text window using the slider on the
right side in order to see all the information. As you can see from the
tournament log, the simulation <I>Simple Example</I> is a tournament
of three strategies only: GRIM, TITFORTAT and RANDOM. Among these
three strategies GRIM emerges as the clear winner.

<P>
Now, let us have a look at the other notebook pages. Select the page
<I>Ecological Simulation</I> in order to view the graph of the ecological
simulation. The graph shows the population dynamics of the strategies
in the tournament, assuming that the fitness of a strategy is
determined by its score in the tournament. It should look like this:

<P>
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
<IMG
  WIDTH="400" HEIGHT="310" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="./eco_page.png"
 ALT="Image eco_page">
</DIV>

<P>
If you wonder how the development is going to continue after the 50th
generation (you probably don't when the graph is as simple as in this case, but
sometimes it takes more generations until a clear result crystalizes out), you
can click on the blue arrow button again to let the simulation continue. You
can do this as often as you like. (To go back to the first 50 generations,
just restart the simulation from the <EM>Simulation</EM> menu.)

<P>
Now suppose you would like to save the graph (maybe, because you are
just about to write a paper on cooperation in the reiterated prisoner's
dilemma, for which some graphical illustrations might be useful).
You can do so by selecting <I>Save Page As</I> from the <I>Edit</I>
menu or by clicking the <I>Save Page</I> button in the toolbar (somewhere
in the middle, not to be confused with the <I>Save</I> button which
saves the whole setup of simulations!). A dialog box will appear where
you can the select a directory and enter a filename for the graph:

<P>
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
<IMG
  WIDTH="284" HEIGHT="192" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="./save_page_dialog.png"
 ALT="Image save_page_dialog">
</DIV>

<P>
This does not only work with the <I>Ecological Simulation</I> page
but with all other pages as well. So, whenever you want to save some
content you are seeing on the screen, just select <I>Save Page As</I>
in the <I>Edit</I> menu and you will be prompted to save the content
of the currently selected page. Alternatively, you can select <I>Copy
Page</I> in the <I>Edit</I> menu (or click the <I>Copy Page</I> button
in the toolbar) to copy the content of the selected page to the clipboard.
You can then easily insert the content into another application, say
a word processor, by pressing <I>Crtl-V</I> within this application.

<P>
Apart from the graph of the ecological simulation, which usually starts with a
uniformly distributed population, you may also want to know how the three
strategies fare in the ecological simulation when they are given different
population shares in the beginning.  For three strategies the population
dynamics can be visualized as a simplex diagram. (If there are more than three
strategies in the simulation then the three strongest strategies are depicted.)
On a simplex diagram each point within the simplex represents a certain
population distribution. The visualization of the population dynamics looks
very similar to a vector field in physics. But, bear in mind that population
dynamics is a discrete process, while vector fields in physics are usually
continuous. (For a more comprehensive explanation of simplex diagrams, look
into the literature on evolutionary game theory, as for example
Maynard-Smith's ``Evolution and the Theory of Games''). If you select the
<I>Simplex Diagram</I> page you should see a picture like this:

<P>
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
<IMG
  WIDTH="400" HEIGHT="310" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="./simplex_page.png"
 ALT="Image simplex_page">
</DIV>

<P>
The arrows indicate the direction of the ``field'' (i.e. the direction
the population drifts to at a certain point). The length of the arrows
indicates the strength of the drift. Big arrows mean a strong drift
while small arrows indicate an only slow population drift.
