Adjustments so that CoopSim works with wxPython Version 2.8

Can now also load python files that user defined strategies from
the "File->Open..." dialog, instead of just the CoopSim *.sim files

Problem of the occasional Error message complaining about already
deleted C++ objects when exiting program solved



CoopSim Version 0.9.9 (14.10.2006)
..................................

It is now possible to change the payoff parameters T,R,P,S from the
setup dialog

Tournament Page will now be displayed saved in HTML including images

Added internal support for demes, so that group selection can be
simulated

Two state automata are always present in the setup dialog. They do
not need to be turend on by hand

Many more, mostly internal changes and adjustments



CoopSim Version 0.9.8c (25.8.2005)
..................................

Fixed listboxes in the SimSetup dialog so that descriptions are now
displayed properly. (Well, there are still some minor bugs!)

Updated PyPlotter subpackage

Can now save graphs as JPEG and extended postscript (EPS) in addition
to PNG format.



CoopSim Version 0.9.8 (6.6.2005)
................................

Added the Strategy "Stabilize" from Paul Boehm (Thank you, Paul!)

The simulation graph now uses a smaller font for the legend, if there
are more than 10 strategies

Added support for psyco (just in time compiler for python on i386 
compatible processors, seee: http://psyco.sourceforge.net). If psyo 
is installed on the system, CoopSim will use it to speed up the application.

Added field "simSetup" to the Strategy class (so that cheating strategies can
read out the simulation setup)

Added Strategy "EndGameCheater(x)" to simulate an end game effect. 
EndGameCheater is disabled by default and can be enabled with
"_egN = EndGameCheater(N)". _egN plays TitForTat but changes to
Allways Defect in the N last rounds.

Changed output of match logs, so that now the first 50 and the last
fifty moves will be loged instead only the first 100 moves.

Changed name of strategy "GraciousTFT" to "GenerousTFT", which is
more common in the literature on the repeated Prisoner's Dilemma
