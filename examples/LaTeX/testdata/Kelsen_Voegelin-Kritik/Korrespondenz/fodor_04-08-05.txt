Dear Mr. Fodor,

Thank you for your E-Mail. I'd really like to send you the text of Kelsen's Voegelin-critique right away, but unfortunately I am bound by the contract with the publisher of the book which requests that I do not give away the text on my own, especially not in electronic form, which is so easily copied. 

But if you tell me your address, I'd be happy to send you a copy of the book as quickly as possible. (I'll try to get another free copy from publisher, which should not be a problem.) I am sure, it will arrive early enough for the deadline of your paper.

I have attached to this E-Mail the correspondance between Eric Voegelin and Hans Kelsen during the time when Voegelin published his "New Science of Politcs" and Hans Kelsen wrote his critique. (Originally, I wanted to publish the correspondance in the same book as Kelsen's Voegelin critique, but the legal successor of Voegelin, Paul Caringella, was so strongly opposed to my commentary of Kelsen's Voegelin critique that he would not allow it.) The correspondance is in German, so I am not sure, if you can read it. It basically exposes the very different scientific and metaphysical viewpoint of Voegelin and Kelsen. Since an answer of Eric Voegelin to Hans Kelsen's critique of the "New Science of Politics" is missing, it does not contain too many points of importance, however.

Regardings the relationship of Voegelin and Kelsen, I believe that the most important sources are the several articles that Voegelin has written about Kelsen's pure theory of law in the twenties and thirties reaching up to a long discussion of the pure theory of law in Voegelin's "Authoritarian State". In the beginning Voegelin defends the pure theory of law, but in his "Authoritarian State" he strongly criticises it along the line of Carl Schmitt's political thinking as an attempt of reducing the political to the merely administrative. (In my opinion Voegelin makes some good points against the pure theory of law as far as the first edition is concerned. But I believe that Kelsen could resolve most of the issues with the second edition in the 1960s.)

The other side of the relationship would be Kelsen's critique of Voegelin's "New Science of Politics" in the early fities. In my opinion this critique is not related to the earlier discussion about the pure theory of law, but it touches different topics, that is questions of proper scientific method (especially the value-freeness of science, which Kelsen, like Max Weber, advocated and Voegelin strongly denied) and of the relation of relgion and politics. 

Finally, there is the question of the personal relationship between Voegelin. Now, I am not sure about that. But it seems to me that Günther Winklers hints in the preface to the German reedition of Voegelins "Authoritarian State", according to which Kelsen was not ready to accept that his pupil Voegelin went his own ways, are not too well grounded. But I can only speculate about that. Voegelins autobiography, where Kelsen's critique of the "New Science of Politics" is mentioned, is certainly not a very reliable source. Voegelin stipulates that Kelsen had left it unpublished, because he (Voegelin) had warned him through friends that Kelsen would only embarras himself by the lack of understanding in the field of "Geisteswissenschaften". For this Kelsen had no reason to, so it were most surely other considerations that kept him from publishing it.

This is my oppinion on Voegelin and Kelsen (which I just could not hold back right now, sorry!). If your paper on Kelsen and Voegelin is in any language I can understand, I'd be very happy, if you could send me a copy, once it is finished.

Once again, sorry, that I cannot send you the text of the book per E-Mail. But I'd certainly like to send you a copy as regular mail, if you give me an address.

Yours sincerely,

Eckhart Arnold

ear Mr. Arnold

Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Gabor G. Fodor (1975), Ph.D in Political Science. I work at the Institute for Political Science of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences (my position is research fellow) and Eötvös Lóránd University (Political Science Department, I teach Political Philosophy and Hungarian Political Thinking).

I have studying Voegelin for some time, and I published a book about Voegelin in Hungary: 'Kérdéstilalom - Eric Voegelin politikai filozófiája' (" 'Frageverbot' – Political Philosophy of Eric Voegelin").  http://www.harmattan.hu/books/politikaelmelet/index.php#politikai_filozofia. The book has been nominated for the best Hungarian book of Political Science.

I'm studying the relationships between Voegelin and Kelsen now, and I have to write a paper till 31 of August.

And I would like to ask for your help:

I have read about your homepage about Kelsen's reply Voegelin's New Science..., and I would like to ask you, send me - of course, if it is possible - a copy of the text by e-mail to me: metakszi@yahoo.com.

Thank you very nice for your kind help.

Yours sincerely,

Gábor G. Fodor
