Earlier opinions on the origin of Kelsen's "A New Science of Politics"
----------------------------------------------------------------------

At the time of publishing Kelsen's critique of Voegelin's "New Science
of Politics" all I knew about the publishing history stemmed form
R.A. Rudolf Aladár Métalll's "Hans Kelsen. Leben und Werk" and Eric
Voegelins "Autobiographical Reflections" as well as from secondary
source which, as far as my knowledge goes went, drew from these two
original sources.

The origin-story found in these sources goes roughly as follows: Kelsen
wrote his Voegelin-critique and sent it to Voegelin for comments. (A
short exchange of letters ensued.) Kelsen then went on to extend the
critique to a book which took on other similar minded interpretations of
modern social philosophy as secular religions and to which - after
several changing working titles - he ultimately gave the title "Secular
Religion". However, he withdrew the book from publishing, because he had
come to doubt the central thesis of this book according to which - as I
understand it - a religion without God is a contradictio in adiecto and
that therefore, modern social philosophies that are by their own
self-understanding cannot meaningfully be interpreted as expression of a
"secular religion".

As a side-note: I think the central thesis of Kelsen's "Secular
Religion" is indeed mistaken, because a) secular creed's can share all
features of a religion (belief-system, rituals, community of believers
and possibly more) only with the exception of the lack of a belief in
God and, possibly, the further exception of not understanding
themselves as religions. But then they are similar enough to religions
proper that include the belief in God to meaningfully compare them to
these on a sociological as well as philosophical basis. And b) there
are creeds that understand themselves as religion and still do not
contain a belief in God. (As far as my perfunctory knowledge goes a
certain sub-division of Buddhism (the Theravāda) doesn't include a
belief in a Godhead.) Hermeneutically, Kelsen's mistake was not to
call into question (or not to allow to be called into question) the
author intention. Many of the secularization-theoreticians and, above
all, Eric Voegelin tended to the opposite, namely, to entirely ignore
the author intention of the modern social philosophies that they
interpreted as "secular religions" - which, in my opinion, is an even
greater hermeneutic mistake...

Coming back to the origin of Kelsen's Voegelin-critique. The story so
far is what R.A. Métall relates and I think it is accurate, though not
comprehensive, because, as a matter of fact, Kelsen hadn't left the
entire Voegelin-critique unpublished, but rather Kelsen's included the
criticism of Voegelin's theory of representation from the manuscript
in his study "Foundations of Democracy" which he published as early as
1955 in the journal "Ethics". (Back when I published Kelsens
Voegelin-critique, I was not aware of this fact. I only learned it,
when writing an article about Kelsen's "Secular Religion", when I
found Kelsen's "Foundations of Democracy" in a volume of Kelsen's
writings on the theory of democracy edited by Matthias Jestaedt and
Oliver Lepsius and published in 2006 under the title "Verteidigung der
Demokratie".)

This said, it can only be considered as a case of malevolent
speculuation when Voegelin claims in his "Autobiographical Reflections"
that Kelsen had left the book unpublished because Kelsen -- probably, as
Veogelin guesses, also as a consequence of Voegelin's warnings - had
come to understand that he wasn't competent in enough to judge on these
matters. Unfortunately, Voegelin's view of the matter had been picked up
by Günther Winkler the preface of his re-edition of Voegelin's
"Authoritarian state". Günther Winkler's preface has been directly
influenced by Peter J. Opitz, who - as other members of Voegelin's
circle - strongly and for some time successfully -- tried to drive the
Voegelin-reception into a direction where, if at all, only the most
moderate an timid criticism of Voegelin was acceptable. (I also had an
exchange of letters with Peter J. Opitz when I published Kelsen's
Voegelin-criticism, and my naive attempt to publish the criticism with
the Fink-Verlag, where -- with the exception of the "Authoritarian
State" -- all of the other (re-)published writings of Voegelin appeared,
was, of course, doomed to fail.

The "true story" ;-) of the publishing history of Kelsen's Voegelin-criticism
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

So, where does this leave us? Again, Kelsen did not leave the entire
manuscript of his Voegelin critique unpublished, but, rather, he split
it. The part on Voegelin's theory of representation went into
"Foundations of Democracy" and was published in 1955. Judging from an
admittedly superficial reading, the part published in "Foundations of
Democracy" is word for word the same as in the manuscript. However,
this means that Kelsen must at some point have abandoned the idea of
publishing his Voegelin-criticism as an independent work, that is, if
he has ever entertained this idea at all. I do believe, though, that
he did, because otherwise he would probably have mentioned his plan to
split his Voegelin-critique and publish different parts of it in
different works in his exchange of letters between him and Voegelin
directly after the criticism had been published. Thus, I assume that
Kelsen has decided to split the manuscript and not publish it
independently, only after his exchange of letters with
Voegelin. (There are in my opinion no hints in the letter exchange
that he has decided not to publish his criticism independently as a
consequence of this exchange. So, the question why he did so remains open.)

The other part of the manuscript which was included in "secular
religion" also remained largely unchanged. Only the portion on Joachim
Fiori as a precursor of the myth of the Third Reich (if that really is
a myth in any strong sense and not just a piece of rethoric) was
changed: While Kelsen did not at all buy the Joachim Fiori-story in
his Voegelin critique, he seems to allow at least some credulity for it
in his "Secular Religion" (as published posthumously in 2012). This is
the only point, as far as I can see, where Kelsen modestly revised his
manuscript between the Voegelin-critique and "Secular Religion".


Regarding "Joachim Fiori" as a precursor of the Third Reich
-----------------------------------------------------------

The point about Joachim Fiori is not Voegelin's idea. Rather Voegelin
took it from Löwith's "The meaning of History". I do not think that
Löwith is overly pervasive concerning this potential legacy of a
certain "symbol" of National Socialism, because a) the origin story of
the "symbol" (if one wants to call it this) of the Third Reich is only
one among several possible origin stories, b) even, if granted, its
explanatory value for the politics of National Socialism is pretty
poor. It is just another incident that shows that the ideology of
National Socialism was loaded with vague and synctretic religious
symbolism, from the fund of symbols that were popular at that time. Of
course, this drawing on religiously loaded symbols, just as the
element of imitation of religion within National Socialism (and other
totalitarian movements) in general, might be one (of several and not
necessarily the most important one) component of an explanation for
why National Socialism was able to gain a mass-followership and to
motivate a certain readiness to (stupid) self-sacrifice by some of its
followers. (Although, I don't think that the soldiers of the
Democratic states fought in any way less valiantly because they lacked
a religious belief in their political system.) And c) even if Löwith
managed to show a historical continuity between the symbol of a third
Reich form Joachim Fiori to National Socialism beyond mere
association, it is question how much of the intellectual content of
this symbol had really been transferred from Fiori to National
Socialism, and if it wasn't rather a continuity on a linguistic or
purely rhethorical level, much like a dead metaphor.

No matter, how far we believe in Löwith, Voegelin did not add anything
of his own to independently support Löwith's reasoning. Rather he
picks up Löwiths finding and presents it without further backing it by
any evidence in a much more radical fashion. This is rather typical of
Voegelin. Voegelin, being himself a rather unoriginal thinker, often
picked up ideas from secondary literature which fit his rage and
presents them with a much stronger claim, that is in this form not
supported by the sources that he used. This is most obvious in his use
of Löwith in the "New Science of Politics" and the intellectual
confusion that ensues on Voegelin's side is most clearly exposed by
Kelsen's criticism.

Concerning the validity of my "Nachwort" 15 years later
-------------------------------------------------------

Since the publishing of Kelsen's Voegelin-criticism, more critical
literature on Voegelin has emerged. I view of this literature and in
absence of any elaborated rejection of my commentary, I believe (in my
biased opinion) that my "Nachwort" has withstood the test of time
quite well. (The lack of rejection may be due that I did not publish
my Nachwort in English, thus making it less accessible.) There just two
points, where I now think it is not wholly accurate any more:

1. The publishing history of the manuscript, which is now known better
   (see above).

2. The role of Joachim Fiori as a precursor the the concept of the
   Third Reich, where I too naively followed Hans Kelsen view, which
   he soon modified to some degree himself (as described above).
