  pages = {429-454},

  abstract = {This paper analyses and explicates the explanatory characteristics
	of Schelling's checkerboard model of segregation. It argues that
	the explanation of emergence of segregation which is based on the
	checkerboard model is a partial potential (theoretical) explanation.
	Yet it is also argued that despite its partiality, the checkerboard
	model is valuable because it improves our chances to provide better
	explanations of particular exemplifications of residential segregation.
	The paper establishes this argument by way of examining the several
	ways in which the checkerboard model has been explored in the literature.
	The examination of the checkerboard model also supports the view
	that the relation between the real world and models is complex, and
	models should be considered as mediators, or as instruments of investigation.},

  owner = {eckhartarnold},
  review = {Very clear assessment of the epistemological merits of Schelling's
	famous model: 
	
	
	1) The model is a partial(!) explanation in the sense that it circumscribes
	a possible cause of segregation. It is not a full explanation because
	there may be other causes as well. Furthermore, it not clear whether
	in a particular case it is empirically adequate (i.e. following Hempel:
	the explanans is empirically true). (p. 435)
	
	
	2) The model extends the bredth of the explanation (p. 437) for neighborhodd
	segregation in so far as it adds an other possible causes to the
	existing array of possible causes. (It is assumed that for this type
	of explanations different causes or a different mix of causes may
	be responsible for the same phenomenon, namely neighborhood segregation,
	in different instances. A "meta-model" is understood as an array
	of models)
	
	
	3) Being a mere thought experiment the model as such cannot count
	as an explanation for what happens in the real world. (p. 440)
	
	
	In the last part exploratory (i.e. further pure model) studies (p.
	440-442) and emprical studies (p 442-444) of th emodel are reviewd.
	
	
	Quotations: p. 445: "abstract models should not be evaluated in isolation
	from the rest of the body of thought developed on a certain topic."
	
	
	p 445: "But if considered all together, different but related models
	of a certain phenomenon help us explain its particular exemplifications.
	As a collection they form something like an incomplete theory, serving
	the conceptual resources to provide singular explanations. Schelling's
	models of residential segregation, their reconsiderations, and the
	other models and explanations of segregation that emphasize organized
	action and economic factors may be considered as forming an incomplete,
	partial theory or a meta-model of segregation. Only this meta-model
	may supply the conceptual resources of a social scientist when confronted
	with particular cases."},

	This departure, its recent development and its increasing application
	by non-traditional simulation disciplines indicates the need to continuously
	assess the current state of ABM and identify opportunities for improvement.
	To begin to satisfy this need, we surveyed and collected data from
	279 articles from 92 unique publication outlets in which the authors
	had constructed and analyzed an agent-based model. From this large
	data set we establish the current practice of ABM in terms of year
	of publication, field of study, simulation software used, purpose
	of the simulation, acceptable validation criteria, validation techniques
	and complete description of the simulation. Based on the current
	practice we discuss six improvements needed to advance ABM as an
	analysis tool. These improvements include the development of ABM
	specific tools that are independent of software, the development
	of ABM as an independent discipline with a common language that extends
	across domains, the establishment of expectations for ABM that match
	their intended purposes, the requirement of complete descriptions
	of the simulation so others can independently replicate the results,
	the requirement that all models be completely validated and the development
	and application of statistical and non-statistical validation techniques
	specifically for ABM.},

  abstract = {In most cases, the meaning of computer simulation is strongly connected
	to the idea numerical calculations. A computer simulation is a numerical
	solution of a complex mathematical problem. Therefore, the problem
	of validation of its results should be only a problem of judging
	the underlying computational methods. However, it will be argued,
	that this is not the case. It is consensus in literature that validation
	constitutes one of the central epistemological problems of computer
	simulation methods. Especially in the case of simulations in the
	social sciences the answers given by many authors are not satisfactory.
	The following paper attempts to content how the characteristics of simulation,
	i.e. the imitation of a dynamic, constitute the problem of validation
	even in the case of the natural sciences and what consequences arise.
	Differences as well as common grounds between social and natural
	sciences will be discussed.},

	Using specific models in economics and biology as test cases, it
	considers three alternative answers: that models are tools for isolating
	the 'capacities' of causal factors in the real world; that modelling
	is 'conceptual exploration' which ultimately contributes to the development
	of genuinely explanatory theories; and that models are credible counterfactual
	worlds from which inductive inferences can be made. The paper argues
	that the 'credible worlds' account captures significant aspects of
	scientific practice, even if many modellers see their work as conceptual
	exploration.},
