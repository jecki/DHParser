Description
-----------


A parser combinator based parsing and compiling infrastructure for domain
specific languages (DSL) in python.

Primary use case: A DSL for the "Mittellateinische WÃ¶rterbuch"!

For a simple self-test run `ParserCombinators.py` from the command line. This compiles the EBNF-Grammer in
`examples/EBNF/EBNF.ebnf` and outputs its abstract syntax tree as well as a Python-based parser class representing
that grammar.
