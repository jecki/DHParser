DHParser Version 1.9.0
......................

- more fine-grained cancelation, not only batch-processes can be
  canceled after each processed file, but now also processing
  pipelines can be canceled after each step. Processing steps
  themselves can also be canceld, if the have and make use of
  a cancel_query attribute. (For the time being only compile.Compile
  offers a cancel_query-attribute, but tree transformations
  and eventually grammar-objects may follow in the future.)
- bugfix: test not to forget to call the preprocessor (if present)!
- if empty tags are not explicitly passed to nodtree.Node.as_xml()
  they will be determined automatically
- auto-generated parser skript now allows to select a particular
  compilation target, like the AST or any other intermediate
  or final stage from the processing-pipline
- automated app-script completely overhauled, now much better for
  exploring parsers and processing pipelines.
- start_parser-paramters added to compile.compile_source() and
  pipeline.full_pipline()
- left_biased-parameter added to nodetree.ContentMapping.insert_node()
- an (empty) ...Config.ini-file is now automatically generated
  for new projects
- a small sub-chapter concerning XML-reflow was added to the
  documentation


DHParser Verion 1.8.3 (20.3.2024)
.................................

- nodetree.py: experimental split-method added to Node-class
- collections.namedtuple replaced by typing.NamedTuple-class
- configuration.py: read_local_config() now reads and processes
  all config files from scriptdir, user's config dir and
  current directory in that order
- multiprocessing code now works with 'forkserver' as well
- Python3.14 compatibility (forkserver,
  staticmethod(functools.partial(...) where required)


DHParser Version 1.8.2 (6.2.2024)
.................................

- bugfixes for xast and nast-serializations
- removed warnings about unused symbols in the AST-table to avoid,
  because it is too confusing for newcomers.
- updates to nodetree.ContentMapping: methods path(), pos() and path_str()
  added; markup() now avoids the generation of single anynomous leaves.
- xml and S-expression-serialization now allows word wrapping
- script XMLreflow.py added to reflow XML-files (experimental)
- experimental nodetree.SerializationMapping added (not yet documented,
  see tests in test_nodetree for now...)


DHParser Version 1.8.1 (19.10.2024)
...................................

- optional speed optimizations (experimental!) that work by compiling
  certain parts of the grammar to regular expressions. See config value
  "optimizations" or put "@optimizations=all" at the top of your grammar.
- serializations for xast and unist ("ndst") added.
  See https://github.com/syntax-tree/unist
  and https://github.com/syntax-tree/xast
- fast-path for Series-parser, in case no items are marked as mandatory
- faster unit-tests: History recording will only be invoked if a
  test fails, in which case the test will be repeated with history
  recording. (If a tested parser contains lookahead statements,
  history-recording is always invoked, because it is needed to
  detect false negatives.)
- unit-test-scripts (i.e. "tst_..._grammary.py") can now be invoked
  with the "--history" (or "-p") option to record detailed logs for all
  tests, not only those tests that have failed. (So, it is easier to
  study what a particular parser actually does.)
- functions added: nodetree.drop_leaf() and transform.pull_up()
- changes: parse.py: removed memoization equivalence classes to
  simplify code (speed up was very neglible, anyway)
  parse.py: Regular expressions of RegExp-parsers are now evaluated
  lazily to keep startup times in check
- nim-rewrite of parser core under way, e.g. run-ranges added as
  first step to get rid of regular epressions.
- lsp-module removed from documentation to avoid index-clutter


DHParser Version 1.7.2 (22.2.2024)
..................................

- removed unnecessary directories from pyproject.toml, e.g.
  tests, documentation_src... These are not required for
  running DHParser and can always be obtained from git
- comments inside insignificant whitespace can now be retained
  by adding "no_comments"[sic!] to the @drop-directive
- DHParser now comes with a few predefined parsing-functions
  in DHParser.parsers. For now, there is parse_HTML and parse_XML
  (in contrast to nodetree.parse_xml, the latter is slower, but
  strictly adheres to the XML-grammar of the W3C except
  DTDs inside an XML-document, which is not supported)
- ebnf-grammar now allows to specify character ranges with
  (e.g.) "[\x00CD-\x0CFD]" (EXPERIMENTAL)


DHParser Version 1.7.1 (28.1.2024)
..................................

- case-insensitive plain-text-parser added (parse.IgnoreCase)
- [config]-section in test-files is now repeated in the report
- Documentation for parse.ParsingError-class
- compile.py: better error message for missing visitor-methods
- HTML-Grammar added to examples/XML
- bugfixes and a few more tests
- more work on experimental nim-rewrite of the parser-core:
  enough parser-classes for standard EBNF, plus error-recovery

DHParser Version 1.7
....................

- refactoring: processing-pipeline-support now in a dedicated module

DHParser Version 1.6.1 (27.10.2023)
...................................

- Better support for processing-pipelines: compile.py, dsl.py
  and autogenerated ...Parse.py- and tst...py-scripts now
  use junctions for each processing-stage.
- compile.py, dsl.py, testing.py: Testing of processing stages beyond
  the AST is now fully supported, as long as the results can be
  serialized as strings.
- SmartRE-parser (EXPERIMENTAL) added for more seamless integration
  of regular expressions: If regular expressions contain named groups,
  these will appear as named nodes in the tree.


DHParser Version 1.5.0 (19.7.2023)
..................................

- parse.py: The (insignificant) "Whitespace"-parser is now optional
  per default. This simplifies writing regular expressions for
  insignificant whitespace, but can lead to BREAKING badly formulated
  grammars, because optional-testing during static analysis is now
  more comprehensive.
- ebnf.py: bugfix for linefeed whitespace-parser and added line-start
  whitespace-parser.
- parse.py: removed methods for combining parsers, i.e. turn cascades
  of nested Series, Interleave or Alternative parsers into one
  flat parser with a longer list of arguments, because these are
  practically never needed and have undesired side effects.
- parse.py: Speed-Optimization by implementing simplified __call__-methods
  for leaf-parsers and for parsers that do not memoize.
- parse.py: class LateBindingUnary added (experimental!)
- testing.py: allow to set config-values in test-files.
- EXPERIMENTAL: started a nim-rewrite of the parser core to increase
  parser speed to the level of a compiled language, i.e. nim (nim-lang.org)


DHParser Version 1.4.2 (19.4.2023)
..................................

- NEW: Macros for EBNF grammars added!
- better support for (post-)processing pipelines (dsl.py and compile.py)
- added an (autogenerated) ...App.py script that allows to select files
  for compilation with a simple GUI. (This helps to deploy projects
  for users that are not used to the command line.)
  Like the ...Parser.py and ...Server.py-scripts, this script is
  generated when running the grammar-tests-script for the first time in
  a new project.
- refactoring of the template for autogenerated ...Parser.py-scripts
  to make them shorter and more readable.
- autogenerated tst_..._grammar.py-script will generate ...Server.py
  and ...App.py script only once and not regenerate them automatically
  if they have been deleted. Pass "--scripts" on the command line to
  re-create these scripts if needed.
- nodetree.py: support for SXML-serialization
  (see https://okmij.org/ftp/Scheme/SXML.html)


DHParser Version 1.3.5 (10.2.2023)
..................................

- bugfixes, some to restore broken backwards compatibility


DHParser Version 1.3.4 (30.1.2023)
..................................

- bugfix ebnf.py: possible name conflicts between symbol names in a grammar
  and parser class names in DHParser.parse will now be evaded
- backwards incompatible change: ident-parameter removed from
  DHParser.toolkit.ThreadLocalSingletonFactory
- various bugfixes


DHParser Version 1.3.3 (8.12.2022)
..................................

- nodetree.Node.evaluate() now supports another "mode" where path information
  is passed to the evaluating functions, making it much more versatile
- Cython is not listed as a dependency anymore in the pyproject.toml.
  To use Cython speedups, Cython 3 alpha 11 is required (alpha 1-9
  are also reported to work, but not alpha 11. Many thanks to Ailton Andrade
  de Oliveira for cheking this out!) and the command "dhparser_cythonize"
  or "dhparser_cythonize_stringview" must be run from the command line.
- a couple of minor bug-fixes


DHParser Version 1.3.2 (23.11.2022)
...................................

- Workaround: Cython-dependency set to version 0.29, because DHParser
  1.3+ could otherwise not be installed with pip. DHParser can
  run completely without Cython. Cython is only needed if you want
  to speed up DHParser a little (up to 2x). Starting from DHParser 1.3.0
  this requires the 3.0 alpha Version of Cython, because older versions
  stumble over "from __future__ import annotations" (which however is
  needed by the sphinx-documentation builder to build the type information
  in the documentation properly).


DHParser Version 1.3.1 (21.11.2022)
...................................

- Bugfix: generated project-test-script "tst_..._grammar.py" crashed
  when trying to read and output error messages from EBNF-compilation

DHParser Version 1.3.0 (17.11.2022)
...................................

- New Requirement: Python 3.7 or greater!!!
  (due to from __future__ import annoataions)
- EBNF-grammars can now refer to custom Python parsers
- EBNF-grammars can now attach errors to the syntax-tree directly,
  e.g. number = digits | @Error("Not A Number") /.*?\d/
- cython support moved to cython3, cython3 compatibility restored
- support for arbitrary data, i.e. not only tree-data in intermediary
  steps of DHParser.compile-module's processing pipelines via optional
  RootNode.data - attribute
- order of detailed manuals in documentation re-arranged


DHParser Version 1.2 (3.10.2022)
................................

- BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: refactoring of names:
  Trail -> Path, trail -> path, because path is much more
  salient and cannot as easily be confused with root
- BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: nodetree.py: content mapping
  and markup refactored by introducing class ContentMapping.
  This makes using content mappings and adding markup easier
  and yield more readable code.
- compiler.py moved visitor_name() and attr_visitor_name() to
  class Compiler. This makes it possible to overload these methods,
  which can become useful, when a single method should handle
  several different nodes or attributes - similar to the way tree
  traversal is handeled in transform.py
- added wildcard()-method to class compiler.Compiler. This allows
  to track missing on_XXX()-methods as well as implementing a
  dispatch mechanism that calls one and the same method for several
  node-names (like in module DHParser.travers)

DHParser Version 1.1.2 (24.8.2022)
..................................

- Added (experimental) support for adding markup to a tree.
  (See nodetree.markup())
- Added content_of() and strlen_of()-functions to nodetree.py
  which allow to select only parts of the tree.
- nodetree-content-map can now also be restricted to parts
  of a tree.

DHParser Version 1.1.1 (22.7.2022)
..................................

- some experimental suuport in DHParser.nodetree for adding
  markup and milestones into a nodetree
- documentation extended


DHParser Version 1.1.0 (25.6.2022)
..................................

- refactoring (breaking changes!) "Node.name" instead
  of "Node.tag_name" and type Context is now called "Trail"
- various bug fixes
- documentation extended

DHParser Version 1.0.2 (18.5.2022)
..................................

- faster parser: now uses text locations instead of string views to hand over
  the rest of the document to the next parser. Approx 25% faster!
- Cython compatibility restored


DHParser Version 1.0.1 (27.4.2022)
..................................

- Some refactorings and performance improvements, e.g. Parser.apply()
  which makes resetting Parser and Grammer objects faster
- Grammar.match() and Grammar.fullmatch()-method added to allow
  using DHParser-grammers like regular expression objects in some
  cases.
- BREAKING CHANGE: Node.__len__() disabled and replaced by Node.strlen() to
  avoid error-prone ambiguities: Node.strlen() vs len(node.children)
- DEPRECATION: Node.tag_name has been renamed to Node.name and
  Parser.tag_name to Parser.node_name.


DHParser Version 1.0.0 (9.2.2022)
.................................

- Module syntaxtree has been renamed to nodetree, because this expresses
  the general character of this module better which can be used for
  any kind of (XML-)tree-structure, not just syntax-trees
- many bugfixes
- Python3.11 compatibility


DHParser Version 0.9.9
......................

- @include-directive added
- bugfixes for context sensitive parsers (capture, retrieve, pop)
- documentation extended

DHParser Version 0.9.8
......................

- Language Server Protocol support extended. DHParser/lsp.py now
  contains TypedDict-definitions for all LSP-interfaces and enums.
- support for local config-files.

DHParser Version 0.9.7 (1.9.2021)
.................................

- test-suites can now contain test-data for tree-transformation
  stages beyond AST, if their output is serializable as string.
- Support for the language server protocol via: DHParser/lsp.py
- reentry-points for resume and skip can now also be determined
  with an EBNF-parser, and not only regular expressions as before.
- Documentation extended


DHParser Version 0.9.6 (1.7.2021)
.................................

- Documentation extended
- Better support for error-reporting from preprocessors


DHParser Version 0.9.5 (1.6.2021)
.................................

- Python 3.5 compatibility dropped! DHParser now requires at least Python 3.6.
  This allows to use typing.NamedTuples and dataclasses for a clearer
  expression of types.
- batch processing: just use several files or a directory or a
  shell pattern as parameters for the xxxParser.py or xxxServer.py-Skripts
- DHParser.compile.Compiler is now more tolerant w.r.t to compiler-methods
  that manipulate the parent tree (`fallback_compiler`-method rewritten)
- DHParser.syntaxtree: added "skip_subtree"-parameter to Node.select-methods
- DHParser.syntaxtree: more functions for navigating contexts, e.g.
  prev_context, next_context.
- DHParser.syntaxtree: added insert() and remove() methods to Node class
- DHParser.syntaxtree: added a mini API for manipulating attributes
- DHParser.parse: added early horizontal tree-reduction to class CombinedParser
- DHParser.ebnf: added ""@reduction"-directive
- DHParser.preprocess:  added support for chaining of source texts via include


DHParser Version 0.9.4 (6.10.2020)
..................................

- better Language server support (modules server.py and lsp.py - still
  somewhat experimental)
- language servers can now also be connected via streams, not only tcp
- Rudimentary Language Server example (for Visual Studio Code etc.) in 
  examples/EBNF added
- faster tree serialization with Node.as_sxpr or Node.as_xml


DHParser Version 0.9.3 (23.6.2020)
..................................

- Complete refactoring of left-recursion algorithm. No performance surprises
  or running out of stack space anymore (see parse.Forward.__call__())
- transform functions now try to keep error messages attached to nodes when
  reshaping tree (see transform.update_attr())
- now using argparse instead of hand-written code for argument parsing


DHParser Version 0.9.2 (11.5.2020)
..................................

- Moved to poetry-packaging <https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry>


DHParser Version 0.9.1 (8.5.2020)
.................................

- Support for various variants of EBNF-Grammars (see examples/EBNF/grammar_examples)
- More static error checking for EBNF-Grammars
- for debugging, notices informing about where the parser resumes after
  an error can be added to the error messages. (See config-parameter
  "resume_notices" and '@ resume_XXXX' as well as '@ skip_XXX'-directives.)
- added support for tag-less parsers: i.e. parser that are assigned to a
  symbol that matches a certain regular expression, say, a leading underscore
  will be treated as anonymous parsers
- extended support for dropping of content during parsing-stage, now any
  tag-less parser's content can be dropped, not only that of the Token
  and Whitespace-parsers
- AllOf- and SomeOf-parsers have been exchanged in favor of a more flexible
  Interleave-parser
- (some) static analysis of the generated parser during ebnf-compilation for
  possible mistakes
- better parsing history (now moved from parse.py to the new trace.py-module)
- some speed optimizations
- refactoring: history tracking has been moved from parse.py to module 
  trace.py (new) and log.py


DHParser Version 0.9.0 (20.10.2019)
...................................

- rudimentary language server support (still experimental!)
- translation pipeline only stops on fatal errors. This makes previews
  even for partially erroneous code possible
- better cython support
- scripts (dhparser.py, dhparser_rename.py) moved to
  DHParser/scripts-directory
- syntaxtree.py streamlined
  (breaking change: Node.select_by_tag() remove, use Node.select() instead
- added DHParser/templates subdirectory and moved larger code templates
  from dhparser.py script to the templates-subdirectory


DHParser Version 0.8.9 (5.4.2019)
.................................

- experimental server module
- json-serialization of Nodes


DHParser Version 0.8.8 (4.3.2019)
.................................

- setup: entry-script repaired


DHParser Version 0.8.7 (3.3.2019)
.................................

- better packaging


DHParser Version 0.8.6 (3.3.2019)
.................................

- default configuration now centralized in DHParser/configuration.py
- dropped python 3.4 support
- infinite loops in ZeroOrMore, OneOrMore and the like will now simply
  be broken rather than reported as an error
- better parser-optimization, i.e. flattening and dropping of irrelevant
  nodes while parsing already.
- no caching of node.content anymore, because this was conceptually
  unsound. Trees are refactored and nodes dropped all the time which
  would require invalidating the cache, which would be hard to implement.
- mini-framework for static grammar analysis added (see parse.Grammar).
  As of now: no use case


DHParser Version 0.8.5 (10.2.2019)
..................................

- optimization: flattens anonymous nodes already while parsing
- optimization: drops empty anonymous nodes already during parsing
- optimization: optionally allows to drop anonymous whitespace and tokens
  while parsing
- major refactorings of node and parser class hierarchy: much simpler now,
  no zombie classes needed any more
- parser_guard() is now integrated into the Parser class: Parsing
  functionality moved to _parse() method, while Parser.__call__() is now the
  new parser guard
- better support for customized error messages + bug fixes
- better cython support (makes it about 2.5 times as fast if cython is used)
- testing.grammar_suite now uses multiprocessing to run tests
- parse.Parser.apply() reworked


DHParser Version 0.8.4 (6.1.2019)
.................................

- customized resuming after parser errors! (still experimental, see
  tests/test_ebnf.TestCustomizedResumeParsing as well as
  tests/test_parse.TestReentryAfterError)
- error messages for parser errors can now be configured to be more
  user friendly (see test/test_ebnf.TestCuratedErrors)
- lookahead parsers can now be unit-tested (experimental)
- customized (faster) deepcopy of syntax trees
- better customization of XML-serialization of syntax-trees
- support for thread-safe globals and configuration data
  via toolkit-module
- development status of package raised to "4 - Beta". It's really quite
  stable now, but backwards incompatible changes may still happen!


DHParser Version 0.8.3 (20.8.2018)
..................................

- new transformation function collapse_children_if()
- restored compatibility with Python 3.4
- StepByStep Guide typos fixed
- bug fixes


DHParser Version 0.8.2 (10.7.2018)
..................................

- refactoring of module parser.py for more simplicity. RE is now
  a simple (macro-style) function instead of a class of its own.
  Class Token has been merged with PlainText. Possible break of
  backwards compatibility with certain AST-transformation-tables in
  connection with Token and RE-nodes!


DHParser Version 0.8.1 (2.7.2018)
.................................

- compatibility fixes for Python 3.7


DHParser Version 0.8.0 (24.6.2018)
..................................

- refactoring of error reporting: it is now done centrally through the
  (newly introduced) syntaxtree.RootNode object; makes it faster and easier
- "step by step" guide added to the documentation
- XML is now a first class citizen for serialization next to S-expressions:
  xml serialization can now also be read with syntaxtree.parse_xml() plus
  better serialization with syntaxtree.Node.as_xml()
- added example: XML-Parser
- added optional CST-reporting on a case by case basis to the testing
  framework, using the "*"-marker to indicate which test should add CSTs to
  the report
- moved compilation support to a separate module: compile.py
- source mapping added if preprocessor changes source code
  (see module preprocess.py)
- new semantics for syntaxtree.Node.__str__: now includes error messages;
  use Node.content to retrieve the content without any error messages
- LaTeX-example: better AST-transformations.


DHParser Version 0.7.8 (29.11.2017)
...................................

- added parsers for arbitrarily ordered elements (parser.Unordered class)
- various bug fixes
- html based history logs for better readability
- code cleanups


DHParser Version 0.7.7 (2.9.2017)
.................................

- dhparser script now creates and initializes project dir
- parsing is now based on a StringView class which other
  than plain Python strings does not copy strings when
  slicing. (Speeds up parsing for longer documents.)
- AST-transformations now receive the complete context, i.e.
  the list of all parent nodes instead of just the node to
  transform


DHParser Version 0.7.4 (2.7.2017)
.................................

- package now includes 'dhparser' script
- more transformation primitives for AST-transformation
- various bug fixes


DHParser Version 0.7.3 (27.6.2017)
..................................

- bug fixes for setuptools packaging


DHParser Version 0.7.1 (27.6.2017)
..................................

- first PyPI release
- added type annotations for static type checking with mypy
- many changes, some incompatible with prior versions


DHParser Version 0.6.0 (23.4.2017)
..................................

first public release
