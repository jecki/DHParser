DHParser Version 0.9.1
......................

- for debugging, notices informing about where the parser resumes after
  an error can be added to the error messages. (See config-parameter
  "resume_notices".)
- added support for tag-less parsers: i.e. parser that are assigned to a
  symbol with leading underscore will be treated as anonymous parsers
- extended support for dropping of content during parsing-stage, now any
  tag-less parser's content can be dropped, not only that of the Token
  and Whitespace-parsers
- resuming after an error does not jump in to commentaries, any more (bugfix!)
- some speed optimizations
- refactoring: history tracking has been moved from parse.py to module 
  trace.py (new) and log.py


DHParser Version 0.9.0 (20.10.2019)
...................................

- rudimentary language server support (still experimental!)
- translation pipeline only stops on fatal errors. This makes previews
  even for partially erroneous code possible
- better cython support
- scripts (dhparser.py, dhparser_rename.py) moved to
  DHParser/scripts-directory
- syntaxtree.py streamlined
  (breaking change: Node.select_by_tag() remove, use Node.select() instead
- added DHParser/templates subdirectory and moved larger code templates
  from dhparser.py script to the templates-subdirectory


DHParser Version 0.8.9 (5.4.2019)
.................................

- experimental server module
- json-serialization of Nodes


DHParser Version 0.8.8 (4.3.2019)
.................................

- setup: entry-script repaired


DHParser Version 0.8.7 (3.3.2019)
.................................

- better packaging


DHParser Version 0.8.6 (3.3.2019)
.................................

- default configuration now centralized in DHParser/configuration.py
- dropped python 3.4 support
- infinite loops in ZeroOrMore, OneOrMore and the like will now simply
  be broken rather than reported as an error
- better parser-optimization, i.e. flattening and dropping of irrelevant
  nodes while parsing already.
- no caching of node.content any more, because this was conceptually
  unsound. Trees are refactored and nodes dropped all the time which
  would require invalidating the cache, which would be hard to implement.
- mini-framework for static grammar analysis added (see parse.Grammar).
  As of now: no use case


DHParser Version 0.8.5 (10.2.2019)
..................................

- optimization: flattens anonymous nodes already while parsing
- optimization: drops empty anonymous nodes already during parsing
- optimization: optionally allows to drop anonymous whitespace and tokens
  while parsing
- major refactorings of node and parser class hierarchy: much simpler now,
  no zombie classes needed any more
- parser_guard() is now integrated into the Parser class: Parsing
  functionality moved to _parse() method, while Parser.__call__() is now the
  new parser guard
- better support for customized error messages + bug fixes
- better cython support (makes it about 2.5 times as fast if cython is used)
- testing.grammar_suite now uses multiprocessing to run tests
- parse.Parser.apply() reworked


DHParser Version 0.8.4 (6.1.2019)
.................................

- customized resuming after parser errors! (still experimental, see
  tests/test_ebnf.TestCustomizedResumeParsing as well as
  tests/test_parse.TestReentryAfterError)
- error messages for parser errors can now be configured to be more
  user friendly (see test/test_ebnf.TestCuratedErrors)
- lookahead parsers can now be unit-tested (experimental)
- customized (faster) deepcopy of syntax trees
- better customization of XML-serialization of syntax-trees
- support for thread-safe globals and configuration data
  via toolkit-module
- development status of package raised to "4 - Beta". It's really quite
  stable now, but backwards incompatible changes may still happen!


DHParser Version 0.8.3 (20.8.2018)
..................................

- new transformation function collapse_children_if()
- restored compatibility with Python 3.4
- StepByStep Guide typos fixed
- bug fixes


DHParser Version 0.8.2 (10.7.2018)
..................................

- refactoring of module parser.py for more simplicity. RE is now
  a simple (macro-style) function instead of a class of its own.
  Class Token has been merged with PlainText. Possible break of
  backwards compatibility with certain AST-transformation-tables in
  connection with Token and RE-nodes!


DHParser Version 0.8.1 (2.7.2018)
.................................

- compatibility fixes for Python 3.7


DHParser Version 0.8.0 (24.6.2018)
..................................

- refactoring of error reporting: it is now done centrally through the
  (newly introduced) syntaxtree.RootNode object; makes it faster and easier
- "step by step" guide added to the documentation
- XML is now a first class citizen for serialization next to S-expressions:
  xml serialization can now also be read with syntaxtree.parse_xml() plus
  better serialization with syntaxtree.Node.as_xml()
- added example: XML-Parser
- added optional CST-reporting on a case by case basis to the testing
  framework, using the "*"-marker to indicate which test should add CSTs to
  the report
- moved compilation support to a separate module: compile.py
- source mapping added if preprocessor changes source code
  (see module preprocess.py)
- new semantics for syntaxtree.Node.__str__: now includes error messages;
  use Node.content to retrieve the content without any error messages
- LaTeX-example: better AST-transformations.


DHParser Version 0.7.8 (29.11.2017)
...................................

- added parsers for arbitrarily ordered elements (parser.Unordered class)
- various bug fixes
- html based history logs for better readability
- code cleanups


DHParser Version 0.7.7 (2.9.2017)
.................................

- dhparser script now creates and initializes project dir
- parsing is now based on a StringView class which other
  than plain Python strings does not copy strings when
  slicing. (Speeds up parsing for longer documents.)
- AST-transformations now receive the complete context, i.e.
  the list of all parent nodes instead of just the node to
  transform


DHParser Version 0.7.4 (2.7.2017)
.................................

- package now includes 'dhparser' script
- more transformation primitives for AST-transformation
- various bug fixes


DHParser Version 0.7.3 (27.6.2017)
..................................

- bug fixes for setuptools packaging


DHParser Version 0.7.1 (27.6.2017)
..................................

- first PyPI release
- added type annotations for static type checking with mypy
- many changes, some incompatible with prior versions


DHParser Version 0.6.0 (23.4.2017)
..................................

first public release
